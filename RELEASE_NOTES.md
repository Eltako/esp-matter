- An optional argument, `max_val_size`, has been introduced to the `esp_matter::attribute::create()` API.
  This argument is utilized specifically when creating attributes of the char string and long char string data types
  to specify the maximum supported value size of an attribute.

# 2-November-2023

All of the non-volatile attribute values now are stored in the namespace `esp_matter_kvs` with the attribute key base64-encoded of bytes (`endpoint-id`+`cluster-id`+`attribute-id`). For the devices that store the non-volatile attribute values in the previous namespace with previous attribute-key, the values will be moved and the previous keys will be erased.

- `ot_storage` partition is no longer required for thread devices as the mechanism for storing data related to the Thread network has been changed in the `openthread` component in ESP-IDF.

# 14-April-2023

#### *Changed how attribute data is stored in NVS*
By default primitive data types are stored as blob and that consumes more space in NVS.
Added a configuration option (`CONFIG_ESP_MATTER_NVS_USE_COMPACT_ATTR_STORAGE`) which uses
the primitive data type specific NVS APIs to store the attribute. This saves space in NVS partition.

Newer developments shall enable option `ESP_MATTER_NVS_USE_COMPACT_ATTR_STORAGE` to save on NVS space.
All the examples have this option enabled.

# 7-April-2023

- `tools/mfg_tool/mfg_tool.py` now uses `connectedhomeip/connectedhomeip/src/setup_payload/python/generate_setup_payload.py` instead of previously used compiled `chip-tool` binary executable which additionally depends on `python-stdnum` module.
- Reinstall dependencies to use `mfg_tool` by running the following commands -
```
source $IDF_PATH/export.sh
python3 -m pip install -r tools/mfg_tool/requirements.txt
```

API Change

```
esp_err_t esp_matter::identification::init(uint16_t endpoint_id, uint8_t identify_type,
                                            uint8_t effect_identifier = EMBER_ZCL_IDENTIFY_EFFECT_IDENTIFIER_BLINK,
                                            uint8_t effect_variant = EMBER_ZCL_IDENTIFY_EFFECT_VARIANT_DEFAULT);
```

- Above API now accepts the parameters for initial identification `effect_identifier` and `effect_variant`.
- If not used, then default value will be used for initialization

```
typedef esp_err_t (*callback_t)(callback_type_t type, uint16_t endpoint_id, uint8_t effect_id, uint8_t effect_variant,
                                    void *priv_data);
```

- Added additional parameter `effect_variant` in identification callback.

```
esp_matter::start(event_callback_t callback, intptr_t callback_arg = static_cast<intptr_t>(NULL))
```

- This API now accepts a parameter to pass additional data to the event callback. By default, the data is set to NULL in the API.

# 25-Sep-2023

API Change

```
esp_err_t add(endpoint_t *endpoint, config_t *config)
```
- Above API returns the esp_err instead of endpoint.

Known Issues
------------
    - BLE memory is not freed if the device has already been commissioned on bootup.
    - Host-based chip-tool shows the following error during commissioning/cluster control, but the functionality works fine:
        CHIP Error 0x00000070: Unsolicited msg with originator bit clear.
